- use the package `json_serializable` to automatically generate the from/to `Json` and the package `build_runner` to generate files by command.
- go to [JSON to Dart](https://javiercbk.github.io/json_to_dart/) and write the class name and the `Json` response from Postman
- take the class model only without taking form/to `Json`
- add the annotation of `json_serializable`
```dart
@JsonSerializable()  //annotation of Json serializable
```
- add the new file that will be generated with your file name:
```dart
//my file name is user_model
part 'users_model.g.dart';
```
- if there is mistake while writing the key from the backend and you want to use it in a right way add this annotation before your field:
```dart
@JsonKey(name: 'idd')  //the wrong word used in the backend
int? id    //the write word in my field
```
- take this lines from the `json_serializable` package in your file.
```dart
 // will be auto generated
factory UsersModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UsersModelFromJson(json);      //from json to object Constructor
Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UsersModelToJson(this);     //from object to json Constructor
```
- run a command in terminal to auto generate the file for you (generated by `build_runner` package)
```
dart run build_runner build
```
> File is Generated Now

>[!NOTE]  edit the auto generated file by your hand if you change any thing write the command of build runner again.
