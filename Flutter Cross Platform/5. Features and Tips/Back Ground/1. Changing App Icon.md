>[!WARNING] image should be png and not transparent

## Change it automatically by package:
1. use the package: [flutter_launcher_icons | Dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)
2. choose suitable image should be __NOT TRANSPARENT__
3. convert it to png format: [Convert image to PNG](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-png)
4. copy commands in package to the `pupspec.yaml` in your app `after sdk`
5. change the `image_path` to  your icon
6. don't forget to include the asset folder in the `pupspec.yaml`
```dart
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.0
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icons/app_icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21
```
```dart
 assets:
    - assets/app_icon.png
```
7. run the package:
```
flutter pub get
```
8. type this command in terminal

	dart run flutter_launcher_icons

## change it manually
upload your photo in this site:
[App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/)
extract the folder you downloaded then you found two other folders:
1. android: contains all photos for android
2. assets: icon for iOS
### Location to change:
1. change the icon of android:
$$ android/app/src/main/resources$$
> __now exchange the photos in this folder by all photos you have downloaded each one in it's suitable file:__

- `hdpi`
- `xhdpi`
- `xxhdpi`
- `xxxhdpi`

2. change the icon of iOS:
$$ios/Runner/Assets/AppIcon$$
> now delete the `AppIcon` folder and copy the the AppIcon folder you downloaded in this place
