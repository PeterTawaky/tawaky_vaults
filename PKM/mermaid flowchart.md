## 1) Features:

1. Automatic transfer of cars to and from the garage without any human intervention.

2. Make a payment invoice according to the period spent by the car inside the garage

## 2) algo:

### input => Process => Output

enterPulse   |  searching algorithm

isElv_1_Empty

grage places[ ]=true

time count [ ]

exitPulse[]

    A[enterPulse];

  

    A-->start_button

    A-->flutter_app

    A-->Touch_screen

    A-->sensor

  

```

### Logic to Enter the Garage

```mermaid

flowchart TB

A([start])==>B[/apply enterPulse/]

B==>C{is there an elevator empty?}

C==NO==>D[/there is no empty elevator try again later/]

C==yes==>E[Searching Algorithm]

E==>F{empty place is founded?}

F==No ==>G[sorry no place empty]

F==Yes==>H[apply motion to motors to move the car to it's place]

H==>I[grage place key=false ]

I==>J[Start time count]

J==>K([End])

```

### Logic to Exit the Garage

  

```mermaid

flowchart TB

A([start])==>B[/apply exitPulse/]

B==>C{is there an elevator empty?}

C==NO==>D[/there is no empty elevator try again later/]

C==yes==>E{at this key there is a car?}

E==NO==>F[there is no car here]

E==Yes==>G[apply motion to motors to move the car outside]

G==>H[grage place key=true ]

H==>I[End time count]

I==>J[/Show payment invoice to user/]
