### this type of decision â€” whether to:
- Use **a single Cubit Instance** that manages related pieces of state together
- Or **split state** across **multiple Cubit Instances** for better separation between components
### Use Case:
	fetch data but i fetch data from different requests and endpoints, they all shape in one component, how to view this component, should i create different instances of cubit or one cubit to handle this case
___
### ðŸ§  **1. Single Cubit
 (recommended if data is closely related)**
	If all the API calls are needed to show _one screen_ or _one widget_ at the same time, and they are part of the same logical unit (like a dashboard or profile screen), then using **one Cubit** is usually better.
#### How to do it:
- create a method like `fetchAllData()` which will:
	- Call each endpoint (sequentially or in parallel)
	- Combine the results into one model or state
	- Emit a new state with all data included
___
### ðŸ”€ **2. Multiple Cubits (if data is very independent)**

If the data is **totally unrelated**, and fetched/updated separately, or you're planning to reuse the logic across different screens â€” then use separate Cubits for each.
- `UserCubit` â†’ handles user data
- `NewsCubit` â†’ handles news data
- Your component listens to both
### âœ… Summary

| Use Case                                           | Cubit Structure     | Notes                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Data feeds one component & is logically connected  | **One Cubit**       | Cleaner, easier to manage     |
| Independent logic or reused across many components | **Multiple Cubits** | Better separation of concerns |
